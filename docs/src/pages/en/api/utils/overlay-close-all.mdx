# overlay.closeAll

`overlay.closeAll` is a function that closes all currently open overlays.

It removes overlays from the screen but doesn't completely delete them from memory.

```ts
overlay.closeAll();
```

## Reference

`overlay.closeAll()`

Call `overlay.closeAll` when you need to close all open overlays.

```tsx
overlay.closeAll();
```

### Important Notes

When this function is called, overlays disappear from the screen but remain in memory and the React element tree.

To completely remove overlays, you need to additionally call `overlay.unmountAll` after the animations end.

## Usage

You can open multiple overlays and close them all at once using `overlay.closeAll`.

```tsx {12}
overlay.open(({ isOpen, close, unmount }) => {
  return <ConfirmDialog isOpen={isOpen} close={close} onExit={unmount} />;
});
overlay.open(({ isOpen, close, unmount }) => {
  return <ConfirmDialog isOpen={isOpen} close={close} onExit={unmount} />;
});
overlay.open(({ isOpen, close, unmount }) => {
  return <ConfirmDialog isOpen={isOpen} close={close} onExit={unmount} />;
});

// Closes all three overlays above
overlay.closeAll();
```
