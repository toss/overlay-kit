# FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

Here are common questions and answers about using `overlay-kit`.

If you have additional questions or find topics not covered in the documentation, please leave your feedback in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/toss/overlay-kit/issues).

## Q. When is overlay-kit most useful?

**A:**
`overlay-kit` is particularly useful in these situations:

- **Complex Overlay Management**: Easily manage chained dialogs and nested overlays.
- **Alignment with React Philosophy**: Define UI declaratively instead of managing state.
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficiently handle heavy overlays that frequently open and close.
- **Large Applications**: Provide consistent overlay management across the entire team.

## Q. What's the difference between `overlay.open` and `overlay.openAsync`?

**A:**
These methods differ in how they handle overlays:

- **`overlay.open`**: Handles basic overlay opening and closing operations.
- **`overlay.openAsync`**: Returns a Promise for handling results asynchronously.

**Comparison Example**:

```tsx
// overlay.open
overlay.open(({ isOpen, close }) => (
  <Dialog open={isOpen} onClose={close}>
    <p>Simple overlay</p>
  </Dialog>
));

// overlay.openAsync
const result = await overlay.openAsync<boolean>(({ isOpen, close }) => (
  <Dialog open={isOpen} onClose={() => close(false)}>
    <Button onClick={() => close(true)}>Confirm</Button>
  </Dialog>
));

console.log(result ? 'Yes' : 'No');
```

## Q. What's the difference between `close` and `unmount`?

**A:**
Both close overlays but handle memory differently:

- **`close`**: Closes the overlay but keeps state in memory. Previous state is restored when reopened.
- **`unmount`**: Completely removes the overlay from memory. Starts with initial state when reopened.

**Use Cases**:

- **`close`**: Use for performance optimization with frequently opened/closed overlays.
- **`unmount`**: Use to prevent memory leaks by removing overlays no longer needed.

## Q. What's the difference between `overlay.closeAll` and `overlay.unmountAll`?

**A:**

- **`overlay.closeAll`**: Closes all open overlays but keeps state in memory.
- **`overlay.unmountAll`**: Completely removes all overlays from memory.

**Comparison Example**:

```tsx
// Close all overlays
overlay.closeAll();

// Remove all overlays
overlay.unmountAll();
```

## Q. Why does state persist when reopening a closed overlay?

**A:**
`close` keeps state in memory when closing an overlay. To reset state, use `unmount` to completely remove it from memory.

## Q. When should I use `unmount`?

**A:**

- Generally, using just `close` is sufficient if the overlay doesn't maintain heavy data.
- Use `unmount` or `unmountAll` when overlays are no longer needed or you need to free up memory.

## Q. Which UI libraries can I use with overlay-kit?

**A:**
`overlay-kit` is not tied to any specific UI library and works with any React-based UI library.

For example:

- **Material-UI**
- **Chakra UI**
- **Ant Design**

## Q. Does overlay-kit support TypeScript?

**A:**
Yes, `overlay-kit` has full TypeScript support.

**Example**:

```tsx
const result = await overlay.openAsync<boolean>(({ isOpen, close }) => (
  <Dialog open={isOpen} onClose={() => close(false)}>
    <Button onClick={() => close(true)}>Confirm</Button>
  </Dialog>
));
```

## Q. Why isn't my closing animation showing?

**A:**
Calling `unmount` immediately skips the closing animation.
To maintain the closing animation, call `close` first, then call `unmount` after the animation completes.

**Example**:

```tsx
overlay.open(({ isOpen, close, unmount }) => (
  <Dialog
    open={isOpen}
    onClose={() => {
      close(); // Run closing animation
      setTimeout(() => unmount(), 300); // Remove from memory after animation
    }}
  >
    <p>Maintain animation</p>
  </Dialog>
));
```
