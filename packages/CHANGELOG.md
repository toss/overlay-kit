# overlay-kit

## 1.8.1

### Patch Changes

- [#161](https://github.com/toss/overlay-kit/pull/161) [`ec07614`](https://github.com/toss/overlay-kit/commit/ec0761404eabe27b07a8ad31cf82df34fb3169f7) Thanks [@jungpaeng](https://github.com/jungpaeng)! - feat: Change to allow each overlay provider to have a unique event ID

  Each overlay provider now uses a unique event ID instead of relying on shared global identifiers.

  This change improves event handling accuracy and avoids potential collisions when managing multiple overlays from different providers.
  It is backward-compatible for existing overlays that do not explicitly set a provider-specific ID.

### Minor Changes

- [#149](https://github.com/toss/overlay-kit/pull/149) [`a98a312`](https://github.com/toss/overlay-kit/commit/a98a312249b5ad0006eec16025c4109714a47265) Thanks [@jungpaeng](https://github.com/jungpaeng)! - refactor: migrate event based store

### Patch Changes

- [#151](https://github.com/toss/overlay-kit/pull/151) [`07f42a5`](https://github.com/toss/overlay-kit/commit/07f42a585e8d2bd8ee6ee0841388e3dc39a287a4) Thanks [@jungpaeng](https://github.com/jungpaeng)! - feat: Add component key

  Fixed an issue with overlay components not properly remounting when unmounted and immediately reopened with the same ID.
  Added a new `componentKey` property that's separate from `overlayId` to ensure React properly handles component lifecycle. Each time `overlay.open()` is called, a new random `componentKey` is generated internally even when reusing the same `overlayId`.

  This fix resolves scenarios where calling `unmount()` followed by `open()` with the same overlay ID in quick succession would result in the overlay not being visible to users.
